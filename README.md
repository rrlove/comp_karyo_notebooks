# comp_karyo_notebooks
Code necessary to replicate the results of the Love et al. computational inversion karyotyping manuscript.

Please note:

* Because the process of dividing specimens into the training and test sets for each of the ten replicates is stochastic, you may obtain slightly different results when rerunning the code.

* Some of the methods, in particular for converting VCF to .h5py, are now deprecated.
